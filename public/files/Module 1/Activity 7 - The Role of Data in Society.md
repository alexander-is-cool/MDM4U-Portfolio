## The Numbers Game

### 3 Things I Learned

- Raising youth to become professional athletes is a business. In the documentary, the director of performance science at Southampton FC said youth development is crucial for their organization. Without it, they would have gone out of business.
- By using data, sports teams can analyze player performance to make well-informed decisions about acquiring athletes. Consequently, teams who do not have lots of money to buy players can optimize their spending to acquire good players for cheap. This allows smaller teams to compete with larger teams who have more money to purchase high profile athletes.
- By combining artificial intelligence and data, teams can simulate players in certain positions based on what their most likely to do. Consequently, teams can reproduce how individual players would play against an opposing team or in certain conditions.

### 2 Things I Already Knew

- There is lots of data collected about soccer games and soccer players. Media uses this data a lot to report games and player performance. However, companies such as EA Sports also use tons of this data for their video games, such as Fifa.
- Many players are overcompensated, and many large teams pay too much money for a single player.

### Question

Do larger sports teams use data the same way smaller teams do, or do larger teams use more traditional methods because they have more funding?

## The Data Revolution

### 3 Things I Learned

- Police departments are starting to use data to predict where crime is most likely to happen. By knowing where crime is most likely to happen, police can surveil that area to prevent crime. Additionally, one of the police officers in the documentary mentioned by just being in the vicinity will significantly reduce crimes.
- China has a social credit system. Your ranking is determined by how you act in public and online. If your score goes too low, you are put on a blacklist and removed certain privileges. This was deja vu when I first learned about it as an episode in black mirror (Nosedive season 3 episode 1) revolves around the same idea.
- Machines are starting to be used to monitor the brain for signs of a stroke during open-heart surgery. This dramatically reduces the risk of stroke during surgery. As soon as a complication occurs, it will be detected and fixed immediately.

### 2 Things I Already Knew

- Artificial intelligence is being used to diagnose medical issues based on a photo with very high probability. They have been using AI for image reorganization throughout the past decade, as it is much more accurate than humans.
- Internet activity is continuously being monitored and logged. Many companies, such as Google, collect an unreasonable amount of data about every user. Even if you don't use Google as a search engine, they track your search history through cookies.

### Question

Will countries like Canada and the U.S ever adopt a mass surveillance and credit system similar to China's?

# Reflection

Before this activity, I wasn't fully aware of the extent to which data was being used in our society today. I knew that mega-corporations, namely Google, collect an extensive amount of personal data for targeted advertising. Hence, I have stopped using Google and have switched to DuckDuckGo and Firefox. However, I was not conscious of how the government uses data for policing or how sports teams use data to improve player performance. Governments using data, in particular, is quite scary as they can monitor all your online activity. Especially in countries like China, where they do mass surveillance, individuals have to be conscious of what they are doing in-person and online. Consequently, I believe that data's ethical use is essential so that individuals don't need to worry about their data being used in a way they do not support. With great data comes great responsibility. Thus, if I am ever in a position with access to data (ex: for a job), I will only use that data ethically. However, I will also start being more aware of what I am doing online, as my online activity's significance may be greater than I think.
