This is a reply to the following question: How can we ensure that data is interpreted correctly without bias?

I don't believe it's possible to ensure that data is interpreted without bias. Individuals can take information out of context, no matter how you present it. All you can do is allow the individual to form their own opinion from the data. However, I believe there are ways to mitigate people from interpreting information with a bias. Firstly, you can present all the data about a particular subject. For example, if you present data that supports an idea, show the data that goes against that idea. Secondly, present the information with various explanations or perspectives. Thirdly, present the data with the methodologies of how it was collected, how it was analyzed, or where it was sourced. If data is presented this way, an individual consuming the information will be more knowledgeable on the subject, which will lead to a more informed and factual opinion.

# Reflection

Answering John's question made me reflect on how to present information so that it is not interpreted with a bias. I explored multiple ways to do this. Overall, I suggested presenting the data with everything about it. If data is presented like this, it will mitigate biased data interpretations, as the individual consuming the data will be more informed on the subject. Consequently, next time I present data, I will present it like this so that whoever reads the information gets the message I was trying to convey and does not take it out of context.
