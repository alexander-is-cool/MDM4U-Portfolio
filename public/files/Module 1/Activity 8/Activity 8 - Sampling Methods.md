# Reflection

Through this activity, I learned about many different sampling methods. However, I focused on two, in particular, stratified and cluster sampling. I explored the pros and cons of each, which showed me in what situations each excels. For example, stratified sampling, where individuals are separated into stratum based on the individual's particular characteristics, may be difficult to conduct if individuals may not fall in a single category. Consequently, if the data is about a vague aspect, such as race, stratified sampling may not be an effective means to sample individuals from a population. Knowing how to sample is crucial for conducting surveys or understanding survey results. Being aware of what sample method a survey uses determines how valid the results are. Consequently, next time I use data from a survey, I will verify that the study used an appropriate sampling method to ensure the data's integrity.
