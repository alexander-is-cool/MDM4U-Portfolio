## Things That Stood Out About the Video

1. The first thing that stood out to me was that the U.S. population scored higher than Sweden in the fact test. I always thought that the Nordic countries had the one of the best education systems. Consequently, I thought that their people would be very well informed about world data and trends compared to the U.S.

2. The second thing that stood out to me was when the speaker showed that the world percentage of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved. This was really shocking as I always thought that the world population in extreme poverty has been relatively the same for the past 20-30 years. However, it's great to see that their are fewer and fewer people in extreme poverty every year.

3. The third thing that stood out to me was how random selection scored higher than the humans on every single question. This showed how we have many preconceived biases or nonfactual ideas that could interfere greatly with our reasoning and critical thinking.

## Things That Stood Out About the Website

1. One thing that stood out about the website was that their Gapminder test hasn't been updated in over 6 years. The test that they have on their website is practically the same one on their Ted talk, which was posted in 2014. I thought that the test would be at least updated to relevant issues such as Corona Virus, or any other fact that has changed in the past 6 years.

2. The second thing that stood out to me was their dollar street section, where they have an enormous collection of photographs of a wide variety of families from different countries. For each family they include how much they make per month and some photos of their house and positions to show how they live. I think it's quite interesting and eye opening to see how other people live in different countries and continents, as it is very different from the way of life in North America.

## Question

How will wealth distribution look like in 10-15 years based on current and past trends?

# Reflection

While watching Gapminder's TEDx talk, I learned a lot about the world's current state and how many of my preconceived ideas were wrong. However, I found their website much more intriguing compared to their presentation. After watching the Gapminder TEDx presentation, I went to their website. I played around within their 'tools' section, which allowed you to construct various graphs with a wide range of world data. Gapminder has an assorted collection of data regarding many aspects of life in multiple countries. This data ranges for many years, which allows you to see trends and how they change over time. An example graph I made was CO2 emission vs average income. In the chart, you can see how higher income leads to more significant CO2 emissions. Much like Statistics Canada's website, Gapminder's website is another excellent tool for researching. However, it is also a perfect tool for making appealing, interactive, and professional graphs.
