Armstrong, Peter. “Why stock markets are up 44% amid the worst economic contraction in history | CBC News.” CBCnews, CBC/Radio Canada, 25 Sept. 2020, www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-economy-covid-19-1.5736696.

## Summary:

Even though there are still millions of unemployed or underemployed Canadians, and the economy is in a ditch, the stock market is achieving record gains. In March, the stock market crashed. Many believed that it would take years to recover from this collapse; however, it only took 150 days to recover. Since March, the S&P 500, an index fund that tracks the performance of the top 500 companies listed on the stock market, is up 44%. The main reason why the stock market is doing so well despite the pandemic's effects is that large digital companies, such as Netflix and Microsoft, are driving the market up. Since Covid19 has forced most things to go online, companies who offer digital services are prospering. Smaller to medium-sized businesses are the ones who are mainly being affected by this pandemic, as they have the least cushion to weather bad times. Additionally, these smaller businesses, such as a local salon, are not publicly traded, so their losses are not represented in the stock market.

## Comments:

I believe the article's information was used well to explain why the stock market is up during the pandemic. The author presented a lot of objective data regarding the market's current situation and tried to explain what is going on with a few possible reasons. He also quoted many finance experts to show what they think of the case. Overall it seemed like the author presented his findings without any preconceived ideas and did an excellent job exploring a few reasons why the market is up.

# Reflection

I learned a lot about the stock market by reading this article, such as how 'Stocks are meant to reflect the future value of a given company' This statement intrigued me, so I started doing more research on how a companies stock price is determined. From this research, I learned about IPOs (Initial public offerings) and market cap. I continued doing research and found how data management is used extensively in the stock market. For example, measures of spread, such as standard deviation, can be used to determine stocks' volatility. Additionally, while reading the article, there were a few words I had never seen, which I learned their definition, such as mutual fund, redemptions, and equities. I found all this information very interesting. I would like to invest my money in the stock market sometime in the future. Thus, learning about these concepts have given me a better understanding of how stocks are traded.
