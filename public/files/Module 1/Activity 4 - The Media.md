Without the media, making informed decisions would be much more difficult. The media collects and provides lots of information regarding many fields to their audience.

In a democratic society, power is separated into three estates: legislature, executive and judiciary.

## How Can the Media Misuse Data?

The media can misuse data by using not accurate, not relevant, or false data. Additionally, they can cherry-pick data that supports their argument instead of showing the full picture.

## A Specific Example of Someone in the Media Misusing Data

In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg leaked confidential documents to the New York Times regarding a classified Department of Defense study of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from 1945 to 1967. These documents showed that the government was lying about the extent of U.S. involvement in Vietnam and that the war would cost more lives than the public had been told. The government used its power to spread false information and data in the media to continue and gain support for the war in Vietnam.

## Considerations That Someone in the Media Should Think About When Using Data

- Have I sourced this data from a reputable organization?
- Have I compared the data with other sources?
- Does this data support opinions I already had, or did I use it to form an opinion?
- Did I show all of the data, or did I misrepresent the data?
- Did I represent the data with an appropriate medium?

## Question

Do you believe that there should be a limit to "freedom of the press" and that media shouldn't be able to publish whatever they want?

# Reflection

As a teenager, the media does not play a significant role in my life as I do not follow the news. However, while completing this activity, I reflected a lot upon the media's role and the importance it has in our society. I learned that the media is essential for the communication of information in a democracy. Without it, being informed on current events would be difficult. Additionally, I learned how the media could use data in a manipulative way to sway your opinion in a particular direction. Consequently, I will be critical of any information distributed by a media source and I will always check multiple sources before forming an opinion.
